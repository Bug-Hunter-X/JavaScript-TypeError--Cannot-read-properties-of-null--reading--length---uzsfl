# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: a `TypeError` thrown when trying to access the `length` property of a null or undefined value.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

This error often occurs when dealing with data from external sources or user inputs that might not always be in the expected format.  Proper type checking and null handling are essential to prevent these runtime exceptions.

## How to reproduce the error:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the `foo` function with a `null` or `undefined` argument.
4. Observe the `TypeError` in your console.
